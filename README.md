# OMR SCANNER

This is a project that will be using some image processing techniques to evaluate the OMR Sheet.
Much of help is taken from [this blog](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/10/03/bubble-sheet-multiple-choice-scanner-and-test-grader-using-omr-python-and-opencv/)

## How this works?

I will try to explain as effectively as possible.
